# ðŸŒ± Carbon Emissions Calculator - Django Project

This is a Django-based web application designed to calculate carbon emissions based on user inputs related to transport, energy use, and more. The core logic is handled in a single app called `landing`, with central project settings handled in the `carbon` directory.

  - `urls.py`: Routes incoming URLs to the appropriate views. Includes:
    - `path('admin/', admin.site.urls)` â€“ default Django admin path.
- **landing/**: The main Django app for handling views, templates, and logic.
  - Most of the application logic is written here.
  - Routes are handled in `landing/urls.py`.
  - Views for processing and returning user input are defined in `views.py`.
